# HTTPX-is-the-ASYNC-Requests
HTTPX is a great alternative to using requests that offers simplicity for simple applications but also comes fully ready for async and await via asyncio, making it a very powerful all-in-one HTTP client for Python. This repo will show you how it is similar to requests and also demonstrate a simple async API request version.
